## Pharos Consensus: Built for Speed and Scale

Pharos takes a fresh approach to blockchain consensus, aiming to solve a common problem in many networks: performance drops as more validators join. Traditional systems often rely on fixed time intervals between blocks and a single node to propose them. This limits how fast transactions can be processed and creates a bottleneck around the proposer.

Pharos flips that model.

### No More Timers or Bottlenecks

Instead of waiting on preset timers, Pharos adapts to real network conditions. Blocks are created based on how fast the network can handle them—not based on a countdown. This makes Pharos much more responsive, especially in busy or globally distributed environments.

Even better, all validators can propose blocks at the same time. This shared responsibility avoids overloading a single node and helps the network scale more naturally. The more validators there are, the more bandwidth and processing power is available.

### Smart, Flexible Design

Pharos also allows validators to contribute based on their own capacity. Fast nodes can participate more actively, while slower ones aren’t left out—they just propose less often. This design ensures the system stays fair and efficient, no matter the mix of validator performance.

In tests with 100 globally distributed nodes, Pharos handled over **130,000 transactions per second**, showing what’s possible with the right architecture.
