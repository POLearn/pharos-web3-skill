## EVM in Pharos

The **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** has become a standard execution environment in the blockchain world, powering thousands of decentralized applications (dApps) across various networks. It’s the engine behind smart contracts on Ethereum and has been widely adopted due to its developer-friendly tooling, broad ecosystem support, and battle-tested reliability.

Pharos builds on this foundation by offering **full EVM compatibility**—but with much better performance and scalability under the hood.

### Why EVM Compatibility Matters

By supporting the EVM, Pharos allows developers to seamlessly migrate or deploy existing Ethereum-based contracts without rewriting code. That means all the familiar tools—like Remix, Hardhat, and MetaMask—just work. Developers can tap into everything they already know from the Ethereum world while benefiting from the speed, flexibility, and scalability that Pharos offers.

This makes Pharos not only easy to build on, but also a natural extension for Ethereum developers looking for a more powerful and customizable platform.

### More Than Just Compatibility

Pharos doesn’t stop at just running EVM bytecode. Thanks to its modular architecture and parallel transaction processing, smart contracts on Pharos can scale far beyond the typical limitations of standard EVM chains. With features like **sub-second finality**, high throughput, and integration into **Special Processing Networks (SPNs)**, the EVM on Pharos becomes a gateway to building rich, high-performance decentralized applications.
