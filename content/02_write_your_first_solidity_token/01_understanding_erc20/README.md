## Understanding the fundamentals of ERC20

If you've ever used a token on Ethereum â€” whether it's USDC, DAI, or LINK â€” chances are, you've interacted with an **ERC-20** token. The ERC-20 standard is the foundation for fungible tokens on Ethereum-compatible networks like **Pharos**, meaning every token of a type is interchangeable and holds the same value.

Think of it like this: just as every dollar in your wallet is worth the same, every ERC-20 token is equal in value and function. This standard makes tokens predictable, compatible, and easy to integrate across wallets, exchanges, DeFi apps, and beyond.

### Why Use ERC-20 on Pharos?

Pharos supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), so anything built for Ethereum â€” including ERC-20 tokens â€” works seamlessly on Pharos. This is great for developers, because it means:

- You can use popular development tools like **Foundry**, **Hardhat**, or **Remix**.
- You get access to trusted open-source libraries like **OpenZeppelin**.
- Your token can plug directly into existing wallets, marketplaces, or even bridges between chains.

### The Big Ideas Behind ERC-20

At its core, the ERC-20 standard defines **a common set of rules** that all fungible tokens must follow. These rules govern how tokens are transferred, how balances are tracked, and how third parties (like smart contracts) can access or move someoneâ€™s tokens (with permission).

Every ERC-20 token follows the same pattern:

- You can **check your balance**.
- You can **send tokens** to someone else.
- You can **give permission** for another contract to spend your tokens.
- You can **track** when tokens move from one wallet to another.

This consistency makes ERC-20 tokens extremely reliable and easy to work with â€” which is exactly why it's the standard weâ€™ll use in our token-building tutorial.
