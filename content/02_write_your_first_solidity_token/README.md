## Write Your First Token

Tokens are one of the most foundational concepts in the blockchain world—used for everything from currency to voting power, membership access, and more. In Solidity, the most common standard for fungible tokens is **ERC-20**, which defines how tokens behave and interact with other contracts and wallets.

In this following section, we'll walk you through creating your very first token on the **Pharos Network**, leveraging the ERC-20 standard using [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/erc20) libraries. You’ll write, deploy, and interact with your token on the Pharos Devnet, getting hands-on experience that mirrors real-world dApp development.

You can also reference the [Pharos developer guide](https://docs.pharosnetwork.xyz/developer-guides/foundry/write-your-first-token), so you can always refer back to it or explore it in more depth alongside the course.
